# 🎮 AI Game Collection (Python)

🤖 This project contains three classic strategy games developed in Python — each featuring AI-based move logic and player-versus-computer gameplay.

🧠 Overview
This project demonstrates:
- AI decision-making in games
- Game state evaluation
- Random smart behavior simulation
- User-friendly GUI using Python

The goal of this project is to show how Python can be used to build interactive and intelligent games.
